# Chess Game in Python
## made using the pygame library

The game supports all the functionalities that a chess game requires such as:
* Moving and taking pieces
* Highlighting valid moves
* Castling
* Check
* Checkmate

The user can choose between playing as white or black.
Additionally, there is a bottom panel that displays which color is next to move and the move count. **Check** is displayed when a king is in check and **Checkmate** when a player wins.

Below are a few demos of what the game looks like.
